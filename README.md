# Student Performance Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective:

The goal of this analysis is to explore the factors affecting student performance using statistical and graphical techniques. We aim to identify patterns and relationships in the data to gain insights that can help improve educational outcomes.

## Dataset Description:

The dataset contains various attributes related to students, including their demographic details, parental background, academic scores, and other factors. Here is an example of what the dataset might include:

a) Gender: Male/Female

b) Race/Ethnicity: Groups

c) Parental level of education: Highest level of education attained by the student's parents

d) Lunch: Standard or free/reduced

e) Test preparation course: None or completed

f) Math score: Scores in mathematics

g) Reading score: Scores in reading

h) Writing score: Scores in writing


## Key Steps in the EDA Process:

### 1.Data Collection and Importing:

Import the dataset into a data analysis tool (e.g., Python).


### 2.Data Cleaning:

a) Handle missing values (e.g., fill missing scores with mean/median values or drop records with missing critical data).

b) Ensure all columns are in appropriate data types.

c) Identify and handle outliers.


### 3.Data Exploration:

a) Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., for numeric columns.

b) Frequency Distribution: Examine the distribution of categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Parental education level).

c) Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients to understand relationships between numerical variables.


### 4.Data Visualization:

a) Histograms and Bar Plots: Visualize the distribution of scores and other numerical variables.

b) Box Plots: Display the spread and detect outliers in the scores.

c) Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between pairs of numerical variables.

d) Heatmaps: Show correlation matrices to visualize relationships between variables.

e) Pie Charts: Show the distribution of categorical variables.


### 5.Hypothesis Testing:

a) Formulate hypotheses such as:

   "Students who completed the test preparation course score higher on average."
   
   "Parental level of education is positively correlated with student performance."


### 6.Insights and Conclusions:

a) Summarize key findings from the EDA.

b) Highlight significant factors affecting student performance.

c) Provide actionable recommendations based on insights.


### 7.Deliverables:

a) A cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

b) A Jupyter Notebook or script with all the steps of the EDA.

c) Visualizations depicting key insights.

d) A report summarizing the findings and recommendations.


By the end of this analysis, you will have a clear understanding of the key factors influencing student performance and actionable insights to improve educational outcomes.
